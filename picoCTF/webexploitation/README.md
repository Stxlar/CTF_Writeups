## 📌 Notes

- Payloads are often heavily filtered — I focus on **bypasses**, **sandbox escaping**, and **manual payload crafting**.
- Most solutions come with detailed **step-by-step walkthroughs** and code snippets.
- All writeups are written with reproducibility and clarity in mind — so others (or future me) can understand every step.
