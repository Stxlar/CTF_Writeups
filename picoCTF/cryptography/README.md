# 🔐 Cryptography – picoCTF

This directory contains solutions and tools for **Cryptography challenges** from picoCTF.

Cryptography problems typically involve breaking, analyzing, or implementing secure (and insecure) ciphers, hashes, and number theory-based systems. Each writeup includes explanations and code when applicable.

## 📂 Challenges

| Challenge Name | Description | Tools/Scripts |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| `hashcrack` | Cracking MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashes using RockYou wordlist | ✅ `SHA-1.py`, `SHA256.py` |

> More challenges will be added as they’re solved.

## 🧰 Common Topics

- 🔑 Classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigenère, XOR)
- 🧮 RSA (key generation, encryption, decryption)
- 🧠 Modular arithmetic & number theory
- 🧩 Hashing (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)
- 🧵 Brute-force & wordlist attacks
- 📜 Python scripting for automation

---

## 📌 Goal

To not only solve each challenge but to **understand the cryptographic weakness** being exploited — whether it's poor key generation, small primes, or insecure hash usage.
